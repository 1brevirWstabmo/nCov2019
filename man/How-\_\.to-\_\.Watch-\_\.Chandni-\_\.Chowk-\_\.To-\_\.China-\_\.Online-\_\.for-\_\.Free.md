Chandni Chowk To China is not only a comedy but also a musical, as it features several songs and dances that showcase the talents of the lead actors and the choreographers. Some of the songs are catchy and upbeat, like the title track and \"Tere Naina,\" while others are more emotional and romantic, like \"Phatte\" and \"S.I.D.H.U.\" The film also pays homage to some classic Bollywood films, like \"Sholay,\" \"Don\" and \"Mera Naam Joker,\" by incorporating references and dialogues from them.
 
However, Chandni Chowk To China also has its flaws, as it suffers from a weak script, uneven pacing and excessive length. The film tries to cram too many subplots and characters into its story, resulting in confusion and boredom. The film also drags on in some parts, especially in the second half, where it becomes repetitive and predictable. The film could have benefited from tighter editing and more focus on the main plot.
 
Overall, Chandni Chowk To China is a mixed bag of entertainment, that might appeal to fans of Akshay Kumar and Deepika Padukone, or those who enjoy a blend of Bollywood and kung fu. However, for others, it might be a tedious and disappointing experience. The film is rated PG-13 for violence, language and some suggestive material.
